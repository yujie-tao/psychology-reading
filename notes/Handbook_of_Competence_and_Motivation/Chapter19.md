# Chapter19: On Becoming Creative

## Creativity
The production of ideas, insights, products, or services that are both novel and original and potential useful.

## Dual Pathway to Creativity Model

**Four P's of creativity**
* **Person**
	* **Approach-avoidance system**
		* **Approach system**: associated with extraversion, positive affectivity, openness to experiences and individual differences in behavioral activation system
		* **Avoidance system**: withdrawal motivation and avoidance behavior, away from aversive timely and threatening circumstances
* **Press**
  * When neither approach nor avoidance is activated, the individual is at rest and creative performance is not expected.
  * That activation of approach motivation predicts creativity through flexibility is consistent with extent research showing that approach motivation is positively related to creativity.
  * Activation of avoidance motivation implies a focus losses and punishments, and occurs when a situation is constructed as potentially malevolent, leading to a narrower attentional focus and higher persistence.
* **Process**
	* **Cognitive flexibility**: the degree to which people switch to a different approach
	* **Cognitive persistence**: the degree of sustained and focused task-directed effort
* **Product**
	* Those that are original yet potentially useful

## Work Situations
**Emotion**
**Exogenous opportunities and constraints**
* Autonomy and support
* time pressures
* task constraints

**Initiating structures**, leadership behavior that consists of structuring tasks and clearly defining goals, was positively related to innovation.

To main ways to manage creativity at work
* First, especially when tasks are complex and heuristic, or when considerable pressure is present, leader may emphasize positive outcomes and gains and deemphasize potential negative outcomes and losses.
* Second, when the situation is aversive and losses loom, leaders may create conditions under which employees can be creative through persistence: They should reduce distractors and stressor and provide guidance and structure.

**Cultural norms and construals**
* Western norms prioritize originality and novelty over usefulness and appropriateness, whereas Eastern norms prioritize usefulness over originality.
* Individualistic cultures value uniqueness, originality and independence and standing out is an important motivation. Collectivist cultures value conformity; usefulness; and focus on duties, loyalty and obligations.
* A focus on gains and advancement (approach motivation) is related to Western values such as achievement, whereas a focus on losses, duties, and abolition (avoidance motivation) is associated with Eastern values such as security, conformity and tradition.

## Conclusions and Implications
* Approach motivation mainly leads to creativity through flexibility under conditions in which flexible processing is facilitated and enabled (e.g., couple and heuristic tasks, high autonomy).
* Avoidance motivation only realtes to creativity through persistence then creativity is valued and sufficient processing capacity is available  (e.g., no distraction, having structured work). 
* Removing constraints and emphasizing challenges and opportunities.
