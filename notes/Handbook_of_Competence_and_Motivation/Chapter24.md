# Chapter 24: Competence and Motivation at Work Throughout Adulthood

## Aging
Physical work capacity declines by about 20% between ages 40 and 60 years, mostly due to decrease in musculoskeletal and aerobic capacity.

**Multidimensionality**
Cognitive aging has uncovered a more complex picture of multiple competence dimension and multiple trajectories.

However, age-differences in fluid cognitive abilities do become noticeable in tow types of challenging situations.
	* Acquisition of new skills that require strong fluid capacities
	* Fluid abilities become noticeable in during multitasking
		* Influenced by decreases in working memory capacity
	
Training and practices effects can mitigate the effect of individualâ€™s fluid cognitive decline on their work capacity.

Individuals build domain knowledge during adolescence and early adulthood as a function of personality, interest, and motivational factors that form trait competes supporting domain-specific learning.

	* Social trait complex)
	* Clerical/conventional trait complex
	* Science/math trait complex
	* Intellectual/cultural trait complex

For older employee at the tail end of career trajectories, demand-competence gaps are most likely to arise under the following conditions
	* Occupations that make strong demand on fluid intellectual abilities and sensory activity.
	* Occupations requiring multitasking that can not be resolved (automatized) based on job experience.
	* Occupations that involve rapid technology-driven change and require frequent retaining.

## Social and Occupational Opportunities and Constraints at Different Career Stage

### Job Zone1
e.g. Cashiers, waiters, cooks, store clerks, cleaners

No specific career entry requirements. Jobs are largely due to work experiences, but opportunities for further advancement past front-line supervisor and management position are severely limited without additional education or certification.

### Job Zone2
e.g. Factory workers, customer services representatives, salesperson

Often requires a secondary school degree, in addition to relevant work experience with competence achieved within a year's worth of on-the-job experience.

Job Zones 1 and 2 enjoy a rapid assent to career competence but quickly reach a career plateau.

### Job Zone3
e.g. Electrician, nurse

Occupations that are entry-level positions through education, training and licensing. Opportunities for career advancement typically stagnant well before career exit unless further education is attained.

### Job Zone 4
Available after completing at least a 4-year post secondary degree. Provide opportunities for career advancement well through middle adulthood.  These opportunities are highly dependent on an individual's own agency for attaining additional education, adapting to changing job demands, and performing well in his or her current position.

### Job Zone 5
e.g. Lawyer, doctor or professor
Professional careers available after individuals attain graduate-level education.


## Motivational Theory of Life-span development

### Primacy of primary control striving
**Primary control**: Behavior means of goal engagement by directly addressing the environment
**Secondary control**: Cognitive, self-regulatory means of influencing their own emotional responses and motivation

### Action-phase model of developmental regulation
**Optimized goal selection**: People first evaluate their present control opportunities for a given goal and how these control opportunities are likely to change in the foreseeable future, how investing a given goal might effect other goal pursuits, and whether selecting the given goal will lead to an overly narrow reliance on that goal pursuit.

**Goal engagement**: Switching from a deliberate mindset of realistically weighing pros and cons to the implemental mindset of being biased in favor of the chosen goal, with enhanced perceptions of its value and controllability.

**Volitional mindset phenomena**: The volitional mindset phenomenon, wherein individuals optimistically bias their control perceptions in order to keep themselves mobilized toward goal attainment, has ramifications for long-term career goals that rely on sustained engagement over extended periods of time.

**Developmental deadlines**: Career status changes that are tied to certain age period.

**Urgent goal pursuit** typical involve:
	* Selective secondary control: selective primary control and metavolitional strategies
	* Compensatory primary control: Seeking help from others or using additional means perviously not tried.

** Motivational challenges** in careers across the adult lifespan include:
