# #Chapter20: Motivation, Competence and Job Burnout

## Self-determination Theory
* Belonging or relatedness
* Autonomy or agency
* Competence

## Two Dynamics
One dynamics follows a hydraulic model in which employee allocate finite store of energy pursuing their goals and aspiration at work.
*  The conservation of resources perspective points a fundamental motivation to conserve, recover and acquire resources to maintain a capacity to address demands as they arise.
* Job demands-resources model proposes that energy is a finite resources that is depleted through use.
* In contrast, a growth mindset opens the potential for thriving by reinterpreting the nature of a demand or people's capacity to respond effectively to that demand.
* Energy depletion through a focus on availability and accessibility of job resources.
* Resource-rich environment, employees are able to thrive more because relevant resources are meeting their core needs.


The second dynamics concerns value congruence. 
* Mismatches between employees and important areas of work-life have the capacity to deplete energy, introduce cynical distancing and undermining employee's sense of efficacy.

## Areas of Work-life
The AW model enpcompasses six areas with specific reference to job burnout: manageable workload, control, reward, community, fairness and values.

* **Workload**: The extent to which workload is manageable concerns not only employees' preferences as to how much they wish to exert themselves but also their values concerning the relative importance of work activities.
* **Control**: The control area of work-life pertains not only to employee's need to experiences a sense of agency in their work but also the value they place on important managerial issues.
* **Reward**: The reward area of work-life concerns recognition from people at work.
* **Community**: The community area of work-life has the most direct relevance to belonging, in that it reflects employees' standing within their workgroup.
* **Fairness**: The fairness area of work-life also has implications for employee's sense of belonging because just treat functions similarly to civility in confirming membership in the workspace community.
* **Values**: The congruence of personal and workspace values opens pathways for employees to pursue goals that are personally fulfilling.

# Other
The core aspects of burnout--exhaustion, cynicism and in efficacy -- reflect a state in which employees are less likely  not only feel motivated but also to translate motivations into action. The primary theme in burnout intervention is to increase employee's capacity to find fulfillment of core motives through their work participation.
