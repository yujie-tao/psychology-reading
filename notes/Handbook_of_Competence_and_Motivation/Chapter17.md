## Chapter 17: The Role of Self-Efficacy and Related Beliefs in Self-Regulation of Learning and Performance

**Sense of agency** -- having the means or power to learn in a self-regulated fashion, such as when studying or participating on their own.

**Self regulation** -- the process whereby people activate and sustain behaviors, cognitions and affects that are systematically oriented toward the attainment of their goals.
* Many researchers have sought to explain self-regulation in terms of personal **feedback loops** that convey information about one's performance or outcomes. Feedback loops involve a cycle of three phases.
  * **Forethought**: occurs before efforts to learn and includes learning processes and motivational belief that influence.
	* **Task analysis**: involves relating a task and its context to goal-setting and strategic planning processes.
	* **Goal setting**: involves outcomes that one intends to obtain
		* **Strategic planning**: entails choosing or constructing advantageous learning methods that are appropriate for the task and the environmental setting.
  
  * **Performance**: occurs during efforts to learn and includes learning and motivational processes that influence one's concentration and action.
    * **Self-control**
		 * **Task strategies**: systematic processes for addressing specific component of a task, such as creating steps for editing a term paper in English, for shooting free throws in basketball.
		* **Self-instruction**: over or covert self-descriptions of how to undertake a task, such as steps in solving a cross-word puzzle
		* **Imagery**: is a strategy that involves forming mental pictures to facilitate learning an retention, such as converting texual material into diagram or flow charts.
		* **Time management**: involves setting specific task goals, estimating time requirements, and monitoring progress in attining those goals.
		* **Environmental structuring**: strategies are used to improve the supportiveness of one's immediate settings.
		* **Help seeking**: refers to soliciting assistance during learning performance.
		* **Interest enhancement**: improving the attractiveness of a task.
	
	* **Self-observation**
		* **Self-monitoring**: informal mental tracking of one's performance processes and outcomes.
		* **Self-recording**: creating formal records of learning processes or outcomes.
  * **Self-reflection** :occurs after the performance phase and involves personal reactions to performance phase outcomes. Involves two self-regulatory sub-functions
    * **Self-evaluation**
      * Self-comparison: with prior level of performance
	  * Mastery comparison: with recognized criterion of performance
	  * Social comparison: with performance of others
	* **Casual attribution**: beliefs that focus on perceived causes of personal outcomes, such as one's ability, effort and use of strategies.
    * **Self reactions**
	    * Self-satisfaction: cognitive affective reactions to self-judgements.
	    * Adaptive decisions: students' motivation to undertake further cycles of learning, for example, by continuing their use of a strategy or by modifying it.
	    * Defensive decision: preclude further efforts to learn because they shield a student from experiencing further dissatisfaction and negative affect.

**Self-efficacy** -- refers to personal judgement of one's capabilities to organize and execute course of action to attain designated goals.

**Key source of self-motivation**
* **Self-efficacy**
* **Outcome experiences**: ultimate consequences of one's performance
* **Task interest, valuing and affect**

**Calibration**: A measure of the accuracy of metacognitive monitoring in terms of the congruence between one's perception of competence about performing a particular task and on'e actual performance.
