* **Stereotype threat**: Situational phenomena that members of negatively stereotyped group experience when they worry about confirming that stereotype with their performance.

* Unfortunately, the motivation to perform well can also result in individuals under threat utilizing inefficient problem-solving strategies.
*  The host of physiological, psychological and behavioral consequences of stereotype threat ultimately can overwhelm individuals's cognitive resources.
* **Working memory capacity**
	* It is the impact that stereotype threat has on working memory capacity that is responsible for the effects of threat on performance. 
	* When working memory is at full capacity, it can ensure that attention, cognition and behavior regulation processes are coordinated and efficient. When working memory capacity is reduced, the efficient coordination of these processes is impaired and performance suffers.
	* **Executive functions**
		* **Inhibition**: the ability intentionally to override an automatic response
		* **Updating**: the ability to maintain relevant and delete irrelevant information in the face of interference
		* **Switching**: the ability to effectively switch between multiple tasks
* Successful performance of procedure tasks relies on these practiced, automatized processes being able to proceed uniterrupted, that is , to 'flow' smoothly. When individuals are worried about perform poorly in a way that might confirm 
* When individuals are worried about performing poorly in a way that might confirming the negative stereotype, they may begin to concentrate and consciously focus too much on these procedural aspects of the well-learnt task.
