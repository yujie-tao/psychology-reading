# Chapter 25: Motivational Factors as Mechanism of Gene-Environment Transactions in Cognitive Development and Academic Achievement

Differences in the types and the quality of environment experienced are associated with differences in cognitive development and academic achievement.

Typically, total variation in an outcome is decomposed into three components: a genetic component, a shared environmental component and a non-shared environmental component.

Genetically influenced motivational factors, what referred as experience producing drives, play instrumental roles in what environments are experienced by individuals, and variation in experience leads to variation in intellectual development, such that genetic influence in motivational factors give rise to individual differences in intellectual development.

**Gene-environment transaction**
Individuals come to be differently exposed to environmental experiences on the basis of genetically influenced dispositional factors, and these environment in turn affect their cognitive development and academic achievement.

**Socioeconomic status (SES)**
Higher SES affords greater opportunities for children to engage in transactional processes in which they select and evoke learning experience on the basis of their genetically influenced interests and motivations to learn.

**Conclusion**
Genetically influenced individuals differences in personality, interests, goals, and other motivational factors lead to differences in the types and qualities of academically relevant environments that children select, evoke and attend to, leading to the differentiation of individuals' cognitive and educational outcomes by genotype over time.
