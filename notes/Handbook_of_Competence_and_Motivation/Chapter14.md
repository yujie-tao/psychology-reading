# Handbook of Competence and Motivation


## Chapter 14: Achievement Emotion
* **Emotions** are defined as multifaceted phenomena involving sets of coordinated psychological processes, including affective, cognitive, physiological, motivational and expressive components.
	* **Achievement emotions** : emotions that relate to achievement activities.
		* **Three-dimensional taxonomy of achievement emotions**: object focus, valence and activation
	* **Social emotions**
	* **Epistemic emotions**: surprise, curiosity or confusion relate to the generation of knowledge.
* **Moods** are of lower intensity and lack of specific reference.
* **Functions for motivation and performance** 
	* Both positive and negative emotional states **consume cognitive resources**
	* Mood can influence **memory processes**
	* Mood can influence **cognitive problem solving**
* Positive emotions can be maladaptive as a result of inducing unrealistic appraisals, fostering superficial information processing, and reducing motivation to pursue challenging goals.
* Links between emotions and performance are likely due not only to performance effects of emotions but also to effects of performance attainment on emotions, implying reciprocal rather than unidirectional causation.
* **Anger, anxiety and shame** can induce monition to avoid failure, reduce retrieval-induced forgetting and facilitating the use of more rigid learning strategies.
* Emotions can be influenced by numerous individual factors. **Cognitive appraisals** of situational demands, personal competencies, and the value of success and failure outcomes likely play a major role in arousal of achievement emotions.
* **Emotion Regulation**
	* **Emotion-oriented**: e.g. using drugs and relaxation techniques to cope with anxiety or employing interest-enhancing strategies to reduce boredom
	* **Appraisal-oriented regulation**
	* **Competence-oriented regulation**: e.g. training of learning skills
	* **Task and achievement setting**: design of tasks and environment
*  **Standards to evaluate achievement**
	* Task-based
	* Self-based
	* Other-based
	* Group-based
* **Treatment interventions**
	* **Emotion-oriented therapy**
	* **Cognitive therapies** : modify anxiety-inducing control believe, values and styles of self-related-thinking
	* **Competence training**
	* **Multimodal therapies**

## Chapter 15: The Many Questions of Belonging

Two properties of the social world make the processes by which people draw inferences about their social standing critical: **ambiguity** and **recursion**.
   * **Ambiguity**
	   * **Attributional ambiguity**
		   * e.g. A tech maker may wonder why a supervisor criticized her work.
		* The ambiguity of everyday social life means that different people can make sense of and experience the very same event differently.
		* It sensitizes people to cues that could signal the status and treatment of their group, and experience called social-identity threat.
		* The worry about whether "people like me" belong in a valued setting is called **belonging uncertainty**,
			* When a person's belonging feels insecure, they can be attentive to even subtle cues that imply they or their group might not belong there.
* **Recursion**
	* People often behave in ways that make their expectations and beliefs come true.
	* When people feel they belong, they tend to be more motivated in that setting.

**Loneliness**
* The subjective feeling of being alone, of being disconnected from others, of having "one's intimate and social needs... not adequately met".
* When people feel invisible, even small acts of social recognition can carry a powerful meaning.

**Mere belonging**
* How even minor cues can create a sense of social connection to ne interaction partners.
* Cues that signal an opportunity to work with others on a task or toward a common goal are also psychologically powerful.
* Imagine that an otherwise boring task will be done with others rather than alone increase interest.

**Social-belonging intervention**
* Users information and stories from older students to convey that worries about belonging and social challenges -- like feeling intimidated by professors, struggling to make friends, or receiving critical academic feedback -- are common at first in the transition to college.

**Difference education**
* Exposed first generation college students to a panel discussion in which, among other themes, peers described how their first-generation status had affected their experience in college, and how they responded to these challenges successfully.

**Empathic discipline**
* Emphasize understanding the perspectives of misbehaving students, sustaining positive relationship, and helping students improve from within the coext of supportive relationships.

**Self-affirmation and values affirmation**
* Personal values offer important opportunities to connect with others.
* Role models convey information about the self and what kind of person one could become.

**Remaining pieces**
* At their heart, these questions involve the perceived fit between self and a context.
* Most do not create a friendship per se, or simply place people on a team. Instead, they vary cues in the environment, or how people make sense of these cues or themselves, to help people build strong relationships and a secure sense of belonging in a setting.
* Rituals may be more likely to have substantive psychological effects and foster group cohesion and belongingness when they address specific processes relevant to belonging/
* Even when an intervention targets the precise psychological process at hand, it must do so effectively at the right time.
	* Early in a setting, people are often most open to new ways of making sense of their belonging.
*  If the context lacks essential affordances, no psychological intervention will be effective.
