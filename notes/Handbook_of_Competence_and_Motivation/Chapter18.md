# Handbook of Competence and Motivation


## Chapter18: Interest

Individuals who are externally motivated engage with tasks because they expect that their engagement will result in desirable outcomes.

Individuals engage in intrinsically motivated behavior because they seem to be end in themselves rather than a means to a separate outcomes.

Several frameworks came to include concept of intrinsic motivation.
* **Self-determination theory**
* **Flow theory**: people engage in intrinsically motivating activities because they seek experiences that reflect complete involvement with the activity, together with the accompanying loss of awareness of time and space.
* **Interest theory**: people engage in intrinsically motivated behaviors because of personal preferences to interact with a particular content.

**Interest as a state-like construct**
* Our level of interest is malleable and can change from one moment to the next.
* The state of interest combines positive affective qualities, such as feeling of enjoyment and curiosity, with cognitive qualities of focused attention, as well as perception of value and personal importance.
* The intrinsic quality stems from
	* **task-intrinsic motivation**: stimulating task characteristics that facilitate an individual's motivation to  engage in a task for its own sake.
	* **person-intrinsic motivation**: personal dispositional preferences for the task that the person brings to the situation.
	* **situational interest perspective**: interest as an immediate consequence of the contextual factors present in a situation.
		* If situations fail to support people's interests, the individuals might lose their interest immediately, even if they came in the situation with some interest.
	* **individual interest perspective**: influence of individual's disposition and stable preferences for specific content as a reason for being in a state of interest in a particular situation.
		* **Individual interest**: latent disposition that can be activated in the situation.
		* **Actualized individual interest**: To signify that experience of interest in some situation is primarily elicited by a person's latent disposition rather than environmental features.

**Interest as a trait-like construct**
* **Person-object theory of interest**: conceives of individual interest as an object-specific and trait-like variable that varies between persons but is relatively stable across time and across context.
	* **Two-component construct**
		* Interest as a two-component construct that includes **positive affect** and **value**.
		* Interest a a two-component construct that includes **stored value** and **accumulated knowledge**.

**Interest development: from situation to disposition**
* **Triggered situational interest**: If tasks and content are perceived to be meaningful and involving, interest development may enter its second phase.
*  **Maintained situational interest**: If maintained interests beyond the particular situation and is associated with accumulation fo knowledge.
*  **Emerging individual interest**
* **Well-developed individual interest**

**Promoting interest in educational contexts**
* Build on existing individual interest
	* **Context personalization**: Matching instructional tasks or educational content with characters, objects and themes of students 'out-of-school' interests.
		* Three dimensions:
			* **Depth**: refers to equality of the connections to learner's existing interests established by intervention.
			* **Grain size**: refers to size of reference group and differentiates between tasks that are tailored to the interest of individual learner or certain group of learners.
			* **Ownership**: addresses the fact that different people can personalize context and therefore own process.
* Generate situational interest
	* **Utility-value intervention**: People find utility value in a task if they believe it is useful and relevant beyond the immediate situation, for other tasks or aspects of their life.
	* **Problem-based learning**: an instructional method that initiates students' learning by creating a need to solve an authentic problem. Problem are means to stimulate curiosity questions that in later phases of interest development are activated form within the person and represent a core mechanism for extending a solidifying his or her interests.
