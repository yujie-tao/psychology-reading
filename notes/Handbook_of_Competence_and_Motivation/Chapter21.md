# Chapter21: Early Reasoning about Competence Is Not Irrationally Optimistic, Nor Does It Steam from Inadequate Cognitive Representation


## The canonical view: conceptual discontinuities between younger and older children
Relative to older children and adults, young children were often found to display irrational-seeming judgements and inflated assessments of their abilities and chances of success.

* **An undifferentiated concept of ability**
	* As adults, we have multiple ways of thinking about success and failure. (e.g. putting in effort, applying strategies). in contrast, a major claim of the canonical view is that young children have access to only one of these perspectives. 
* **Overly concrete and positive e representation of self**
	* Harter argues that your children's immature mental representations impose a fundamental limit on their ability to reason about the self, with downstream consequences for their reasoning about competence as well.
* **Wishful thinking**
	* Having frequently experienced the contiguity between their desires (e.g.'I want food') and events in the world (e.g. 'I am fed'), young children may develop an exaggerated sense of personal efficacy, believing that their desires have a direct casual effect on the world. 

## The case against developmental discontinuity
* Is there Sharpe discontinuity in competence judgement?
* Insensitivity to outcomes
* Absence of, and insensitivity to, social comparison
* Are there sharp discontinuities in the concepts underlying competence judgements
* Egocentrism
* Inability to compare abstract quantities
* Overly concrete mental representations
* Immature reasoning about physical causality
* Inability to understand ability as a trait

All above assumption have been proved wrong in experiments. Young people can make sense of their achievement experiences in all the same ways that older children can, and they are thus vulnerable to the same negative, helpless patterns of cognitions and behaviors.

On the one hand, it is clear that young children's judgements are not blindly optimistic. On the other hand, young children's answers in many studies do have a more optimistic bent than those of older children.

The relative positivity of young children competence judgements is likely to arise not form their conceptual shortcomings but rather from the fact that their typical social environments (1) emphasize effort and downplay individual difference between children and (2) condone, or even encourage, self-congratulatory judgements and behaviors.
